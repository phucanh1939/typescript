# Decorators

## What is decorators

A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a `class`, `method`, `accessor`, `property`, or `parameter`. Decorators use the form `@expression`, where `expression` must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

For example, given the decorator `@sealed` we might write the `sealed` function as follows:

```typescript
    function sealed(target: Object) {
        // do something with 'target' ...
    }
```
